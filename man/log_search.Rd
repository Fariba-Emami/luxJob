} else {
  print("Failed to log search.")
}

# Log another search
log_search(user_id = 5, query = "R programming courses")

# Examples of invalid input (will cause errors before DB interaction)
try(log_search(user_id = "abc", query = "test"))
try(log_search(user_id = 1, query = ""))
try(log_search(user_id = c(1, 2), query = "multi user"))
